"""
    Use the final version of electric_car.py from this section.
Add a method to the Battery class called upgrade_battery(). This method
should check the battery size and set the capacity to 100 if it isn’t already.
Make an electric car with a default battery size, call get_range() once, and
then call get_range() a second time after upgrading the battery. You should
see an increase in the car’s range.
